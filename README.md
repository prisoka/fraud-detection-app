# Fraud Detection Study Case

## Deployed URL: 

## What are you looking at? 
Fraud-detection is a Front-end app built for (hypothetical) employees to review potential fraudulent events based on a data model that surfaces the probabiity of an event being fraudulent. 

Built in one day as part of a collaborative case study in partnership with 4 members from Galvanize's Data Science Immersive who were responsible for analyzing the data, to build the model and the backend. 

I built the front-end that consumes the latest events in real-time.
