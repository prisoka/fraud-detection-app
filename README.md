# Fraud Detection Study Case

## Deployed URL: 

## What are you looking at? 
Front-end dashboard built for (hypothetical) employees at an event company to review potential fraudulent events (in real time) based on a data model that surfaces the likelihood of an event being fraudulent.

This was built by prisoka in one day days as part of a collaborative case study, in partnership with 4 members from Galvanize's Data Science Immersive. The Data Science team analyzed training data to build the model as well as the API and the front-end pulls in the latest events in real-time.
